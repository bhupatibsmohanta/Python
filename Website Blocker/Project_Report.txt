Website Blocker with Python.

The employees of Edulyt India can access internet through Edulyt Browser(GUI).
The user have to enter the website(e.g. google.com, facebook.com etc.) they want to visit.
The GUI will decide whether the user can have the acess to the entered website.
If the user tries to visit blocked sites during working hours then an error message will pop up or else Google Chrome browser will open the mentioned website.

Botton on the GUI will act as while-loop which will reponse each time it is clicked.
On each click the program will acess the Blockedsite_Database file.
if the entered website is in Blockedsite_Database then it will compare the access time with granted acess time.

We can control Google Chrome browser using selenium python package which will require chromedriver.
So, install chromedriver according to your chrome browser version. (My Google Chrome Version 83.0.4103.116.)

Download your chromedriver.exe according to your Google Chrome Browser from the link below:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
