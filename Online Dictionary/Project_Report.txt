Online Dictionary with Python

Given json file ('data.json') is our physical dictionary containing meanings of every word. 
So, arr is the list of all the words in the dictionary or data.json.

get_close_matches(word, list_to_be_matched = arr, n=3, cutoff=0.6)
    Use SequenceMatcher to return list of the best "good enough" matches.
    
    word is a sequence for which close matches are desired (typically a string).
    
    list_to_be_matched is a list of sequences against which to match word(typically a list of strings).
    
    Optional arg n (default 3) is the maximum number of close matches to return.  
    n must be > 0.
    
    Optional arg cutoff or threshold (default 0.6) is a float in [0, 1].  
    list_to_be_matched that don't score at least that similar to word are ignored.
    
    The best (no more than n) matches among the possibilities are returnedin a list, 
    sorted by similarity score, most similar first.


We need to match the input string by the user in all three cases (to make up for user mistakes) :
		(i) each letter in upper case.
		(ii) each letter in lower case.
		(iii) first letter is in upper case and others in lower case.
P.S. It is needed to be done as the get_close_matches() is case sensitive and 
	only correct keys for the entered word are in data.json


OUTPUT :
	print the meaning of the entered word if found.
	print all the closed_matches meanings of the entered words.
